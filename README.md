# My Academic Website

This is my personal academic website. I built it using the [Minimalist Hugo Template for Academic Websites](https://github.com/pmichaillat/hugo-website) created by Pascal Michaillat.

The template uses Hugo with a modified version of the PaperMod theme, optimized for academic websites.
