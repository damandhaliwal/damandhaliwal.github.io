##### Abstract

Given the rise in the economic power of the Big Three, their actions are under a spotlight by academics, Wall Street, corporate managers and regulators. Every publicly spoken word by the leaders of these companies is weighed heavily in the industry. Therefore, there is an increasing need to understand what kind of corporate governance decisions the Big Three make as well as the incentives that drive them towards making those decisions.
